# SQL-FineBuild v3.5

This Repository should be used to hold any enhancements from v3.4

The files for each release of SQL Server are found in the _SQL2017_, _SQL2016_, etc folders.  The _Build Scripts_ folder is common to all releases and is shown in a separate folder.

To prepare the code for use, download the relevant folder for your version of SQL Server, then download the _Build Scripts_ folder and copy it into the _\FineBuild_ folder.  

Documentation is found on the [SQL FineBuild Wiki](https://github.com/SQL-FineBuild/Common/wiki).

Changes compared to v3.4.0:

* Various small bug fixes
* Added parameter /ClusWinSuffix:
* Added support for Windows Server 2019

SQL FineBuild v3.5.0 and v3.4.2 currently are identical
